13. What benefit of cloud computing allows you to increase or decrease the power or quantity of resources at any time, without extensive installation or physical processes of provisioning?
b
Scalability enables automatic adjustment of compute and storage capacity in real time to match changing demand without manual provisioning. This ensures performance remains consistent during peak periods while minimizing wasted resources and cost during off‑peak times.

14. You have been hired as an IT summer intern for a small, but quickly expanding, restaurant chain. The restaurant chain owner wants to expand her online presence by creating a website that will add more online features such as downloadable menus, real-time reservations, online ordering, web-based email, and a possible interactive chat during restaurant hours.
The website will have high access demands from the 4:00 pm to 11:00 pm peak hours, and slower access demands during off-peak hours. The owner does not have any IT experience and does not want to become involved in the extra work of maintaining IT equipment.
What do you recommend she do?
b
Implement a public cloud‑computing environment because it provides fully managed, on‑demand infrastructure that scales automatically with fluctuating traffic. This removes the need for in‑house IT expertise or hardware maintenance while only paying for resources when they’re actually used.

15. Public cloud vendors have a common definition of what aspects of security are the vendor’s responsibility and what aspects of security are the end user’s responsibility. This is referred to as the Shared Responsibility Model. Under the Shared Responsibility Model, which of the following would be the end user’s responsibility?
d
Encryption of data stored within a cloud storage service is the user’s responsibility because the provider ensures infrastructure security and availability but users must protect the confidentiality of their own data.

16. The ______________ model requires no software installation and focuses on design simplicity and ease of use. It offers a minimal level of service customization.
b
Software‑as‑a‑Service delivers fully managed applications accessible via a browser with no local installation required, offering minimal customization while offloading all maintenance to the provider.

17. You are leading a team of developers on a project whose goal is to improve customer experience on a credit card company’s website. The solution requires that the developers write business requirement‑oriented custom code.
Your client wants the developers not to have the overhead of managing operating systems, runtimes, and middleware. Which of the following cloud offerings would you suggest to your client?
b
Platform‑as‑a‑Service (PaaS) provides a fully managed runtime environment so developers can focus solely on writing and deploying code without handling OS, middleware, or infrastructure. This reduces operational overhead while still allowing custom application development.
