d) Storage\
Cloud storage provides scalable and virtually unlimited capacity for saving and retaining data, supporting various formats like object storage, block storage, and file storage.

### The ___________________ cloud service model offers the greatest amount of user customization and control but requires the greatest amount of user administration including the operating system, but not physical hardware.
a) Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)\
IaaS provides the highest level of control over virtualized resources, including servers, storage, and networking, while the cloud provider manages the physical hardware.

### What benefit of cloud computing allows you to increase or decrease the power or quantity of resources at any time, without extensive installation or physical processes of provisioning?
b) Scalability\
Scalability in cloud computing allows users to dynamically adjust resources (such as computing power, storage, or network capacity) based on demand without the need for physical infrastructure changes.

### You have been hired as an IT summer intern for a small, but quickly expanding, restaurant chain. The restaurant chain owner wants to expand her online presence by creating a website that will add more online features such as downloadable menus, real-time reservations, online ordering, web-based email, and a possible interactive chat during restaurant hours. The website will have high access demands from the 4:00 pm to 11:00 pm peak hours, and slower access demands during off-peak hours. The owner does not have any IT experience and does not want to become involved in the extra work of maintaining IT equipment. What do you recommend she do?
b) Implement a public cloud-computing environment.\
A public cloud solution is ideal for a small but expanding business because it offers scalability to handle peak traffic, requires no IT maintenance from the owner, and provides cost-effective, on-demand resources.

### Public cloud vendors have a common definition of what aspects of security are the vendor's responsibility and what aspects of security are the end user's responsibility. This is referred to as the Shared Responsibility Model. Under the Shared Responsibility Model, which of the following would be the end user's responsibility?
d) Encryption of data stored within a cloud storage service such as Amazon Elastic Block Store\
Under the Shared Responsibility Model, cloud providers manage the physical infrastructure, hardware, and availability, while end users are responsible for securing their data, including encryption and access control.

### The ___________________ model requires no software installation and focuses on design simplicity and ease of use. It offers a minimal level of service customization.
b) Software-as-a-Service\
SaaS delivers fully managed applications over the internet, requiring no installation, and prioritizes ease of use with minimal customization options.

### You are leading a team of developers on a project whose goal is to improve customer experience on a credit card company's website. The solution requires that the developers write business requirement-oriented custom code. Your client wants the developers not to have the overhead of managing operating systems, runtimes, and middleware. Which of the following cloud offerings would you suggest to your client?
b) Platform as a Service (PaaS)\
PaaS allows developers to focus on writing business-oriented custom code without managing operating systems, runtimes, or middleware, making it the best choice for this project.

### A business uses a combination of vendor-managed hardware, such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, and its own hardware on premises to host virtualized resources. This is an example of the ___________ cloud deployment model.
