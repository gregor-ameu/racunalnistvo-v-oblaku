14. You have been hired as an IT summer intern for a small, but quickly expanding, restaurant chain. The restaurant chain owner wants to expand her online presence by creating a website that will add more online features such as downloadable menus, real-time reservations, online ordering, web-based email, and a possible interactive chat during restaurant hours.
The website will have high access demands from the 4:00 pm to 11:00 pm peak hours, and slower access demands during off-peak hours. The owner does not have any IT experience and does not want to become involved in the extra work of maintaining IT equipment.
What do you recommend she do?
b
Implement a public cloud‑computing environment because it provides fully managed, on‑demand infrastructure that scales automatically with fluctuating traffic. This removes the need for in‑house IT expertise or hardware maintenance while only paying for resources when they’re actually used.

15. Public cloud vendors have a common definition of what aspects of security are the vendor’s responsibility and what aspects of security are the end user’s responsibility. This is referred to as the Shared Responsibility Model. Under the Shared Responsibility Model, which of the following would be the end user’s responsibility?
d
Encryption of data stored within a cloud storage service is the user’s responsibility because the provider ensures infrastructure security and availability but users must protect the confidentiality of their own data.
